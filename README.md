# Python-GUI-Bookstore
Book Management System is developed using Python. The theme of the project is to allow the user to store and manage information about books. The user can perform the all basic functionality of a bookstore. Various validations are imposed on the fields in the program so that the user provide necessary and proper formatted information.

The **frontend.exe** is a standalone exe file which means it does not require any script to run the application.
